## What is Let's Talk?

To begin using, visit: https://lets-talk-together.com

[Let's Talk](https://lets-talk-together.com) is an Open Source platform designed **to give a voice to those who are unable to speak for themselves**. Being able to speak with others is something that we take for granted, but for those with speech impairments, it can be incredibly isolating. Let's Talk aims to change that.
