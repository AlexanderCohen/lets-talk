## What is Let's Talk?

To begin using, visit: https://lets-talk-together.com

[Let's Talk](https://lets-talk-together.com) is an Open Source platform designed **to give a voice to those who are unable to speak for themselves**. Being able to speak with others is something that we take for granted, but for those with speech impairments, it can be incredibly isolating. Let's Talk aims to change that.

If you speech impaired, or a family member of someone who is, we would highly appreciate any Feedback on your experience with the app and suggestions for how we can improve it.
