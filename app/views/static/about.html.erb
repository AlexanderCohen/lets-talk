    <p class="text-gray-600">
      <a href="https://lets-talk-together.com" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Let's Talk</a> is an Open Source platform designed <strong>to give a voice to those who are unable to speak for themselves</strong>. Being able to speak with others is something that we take for granted, but for those with speech impairments, it can be incredibly isolating. Let's Talk aims to change that.
